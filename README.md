# BolognasBot
Designed to be an all-in-one economy and trading system specifically for my Discord server.
Some notable features of this bot are: 

Full MongoDB integration -
With a strong and scalable databse this enables the bot to be extremely powerful and versatile. 
The bot is able to hook to my Minecraft server and other medians in order to distribute currency 
or in unique and fun ways without web-hooking or calls.

Multiple API integrations -
Allows the bot to do things like translate your text to a British accent, return images upon request,
retrieves quotes, etc.

Built using modular code - 
Easily allows new commands and events to be added without disturbing the orginization of the project.
